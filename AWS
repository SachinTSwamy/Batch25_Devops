Lunch Template
  AMI
    Amazon machine image, its a prototype of a existing instance with all the configuration and s/w and application in it. ## You can say as a docker image
    Practical,
              1. Select a EC2 (that u want to create a copy of) ----> Actions --> image and template --> Create image
                 image name --> "Check the box" Reboot instance( if u need data of "RAM" to be included in AMI) ----> *if required add volume by selecting snapshot of that volume --> Creat image

              2. Create Lunch template ---> Name of LT ----> "check box" if u want auto scale EC2 ---> select the AMI --->
                                            Select instance type (It will be for Auto scalled instance type) ----> Key pair name 
                                            --> Network settings ---> Storage ---> Tags ----> " Create lunch template"

   NOTE: 
        Lunch Template vs Lunch Configuration
          LT ---> its a modern mechnisum of lunching a template, where it provides a new feature called "Versioning" of Templates.
          LC ---> its a traditional way of lunching a template , where any changes/edit in image needed to made, it has to be from selecting a new instance itself from the begining
