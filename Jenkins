          3. Project based matrix authorization Security
          4. Logged in Users ( Default)

      1. username and password
      2. SSH 
      3. Secret text
      4. Secret file

 Create a freestyle job with git push, jobs is built
        Job,
            SCM ---> git ---> credentials
            Trigger--->Add Crontab # for checking the git push in repo, to built the new changes that are made in the code

  4. Plugins
       it extends the functionalityb of the application
       ex:
            Jenkins dashboard --> Manage jenkins --> System Config --> Plugins
            available plugins --> 
                        AWS crendentials ## downloads the plugins
                        


 Jobs,
      Freestyle
      Pipeline
      Folder
      Multibranch pipeline

   Freestyle
      1. General 
            - Enable project based Security
            - Discard old Builds   --> 1. By No of Days 2. By No of Builds
            - Github project
            - this project is parameterized
            - 

      2. SCM
            - None
            - Git
            - Subversion (Add by plugin # SVM plugins)

      3. Trigger
            - Trigger builds remotely
            - Build after other projects are build # upstream and downstream
                        if A jobs executes B jobs execute --downstream
                        if B jobs executes A jobs execute --Upstream
            - Build periodically # crontab
            - Poll SCM
            - GIthub hook trigger for GITScm Polling

      Imp:
            Build periodically vs Poll SCM?
            Poll SCM vs Webhook 
      6. Post build Actions
            - Add post build actions
                  - is stable
                  - unstable 
                  - fails
